# Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data on various property attributes such as location, size, and amenities, we build predictive models to estimate housing prices accurately. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, outlier removal, feature encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance
- Comparison of multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Regression models, ensemble learning, feature selection
- **Visualization Tools**: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You can set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
```

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset used contains details on:
- Location (city, neighborhood, coordinates)
- Structural features (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)
- Economic indicators (market trends, interest rates)
- Additional features (pools, garages, gardens)

## Usage
### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-price-prediction.git
cd housing-price-prediction
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

3. Evaluate model performance:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Model Performance
The models were evaluated using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

### Results
| Model          | R² Score | MAE  |
|---------------|----------|------|
| Linear Regression | 0.56 | 24,500 |
| Random Forest  | 0.71 | 18,200 |
| XGBoost       | 0.75 | 16,900 |

## Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
- Integration with web applications for real-time predictions
- Deployment as a REST API
